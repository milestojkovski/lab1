
This is my lab 1.

I exported the database (jokes.sql) with some testing data. You can just import it right away (it creates database jokes).  

There are two bugs:
In statistic about the day with most jokes there is problem when there are 2 dates with same amount of jokes. 
    I had some idea to get the number of affected rows and try to display the date but i had problems and could not solve this. 

Also during testing from time to time when i paste some content it says that the joke was added but actually it is not. 
  I am trying to figure out what is the problem since it is so random. 

I am looking forward to the feedback.
